# Communication Protocol

## Description

JSON is inefficient for transferring data, especially float arrays. What other options are there?

## Assumptions

-   Websockets are used, so the protocol needs either use JSON or a binary format.
-   The backend is written in Rust, so support is required.
-   Both sides know the schema, so schema information does not need to be in the message.

## Solutions

### [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)

### [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html)

### [FlatBuffers](https://flatbuffers.dev/)

### [CBOR](https://cbor.io/)

### [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)

### Custom protocol

## Decision

TBD
